        <h2>The original game</h2>
        <p><a href="original/index.html">Play the original game</a></p>
        <p>This is the classic version of the game from 1983, designed for 2 players. The object of the game is to keep going longer than your opponent.</p>
        <p>The board starts yellow with a black border. Each player must steer themselves into blank (yellow) space and avoid hitting the border, the other player, or themselves.</p>

        <strong>Player controls:</strong>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
            <caption>Controls for Players</caption>
            <tr>
                <th>Player</th>
                <th>Turn Left</th>
                <th>Turn Right</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Player 1</td>

            <summary>Technical details and history</summary>
            <p>This classic DOM-based version uses standard HTML elements and <code>document.write</code>. It was written in JavaScript around 1998, based on my very first version from 1983 on a PDP-11 using ANSI escape sequences.</p>
            <p>The name "Domino" was inspired by the character-based terminal screen that resembled domino tiles being laid.</p>
            <p>I am keeping the original for simplicity and plan to use it as a base to allow more players and transition to HTML Canvas, eventually removing <code>document.write</code>.</p>

            <summary>More details</summary>
            <p>This version will use HTML Canvas, may use objects selectively, and aims for readability for newcomers. It will likely allow more than 2 players and include a practice mode for simpler controls.</p>
