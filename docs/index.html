        This is the classic, but outdated, DOM-based version built years ago. It uses
        standard HTML elements (TABLE, TR, TD) rather than canvas. It also relies on
        <code>document.write</code>, which is long deprecated. It was written in JavaScript
        around 1998. Going back even further, I created the very first version of "domino" in
        1983 on a PDP-11 in Coral-66 running on a VT100 terminal using ANSI escape sequences.

        This is the new canvas-based rewrite. It’s still being developed, but the goal
        is a smoother, more modern version that’s easier to extend.
