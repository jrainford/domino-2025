        <p>Step back to 1983! A two-player challenge where the goal is simple: survive longer than your opponent.</p>
        <p>Board starts yellow with a black border. Navigate into empty spaces and avoid the border, the other player,
            and yourself (see Practice Mode below).</p>

            <summary>Technical Details and History</summary>
            <p>This original DOM-based version uses standard HTML elements and the long-deprecated
                <code>document.write</code>. Written in JavaScript around 1998, it was inspired by my first 1983 version
                on a PDP-11, written in Coral-66 and run from a VT100 terminal.</p>
            <p>The name "Domino" comes from the terminal screen looking like domino tiles being laid.</p>
            <p>Keeping this original for simplicity of code readability for newcomers to programming.
                See plans for new 2025 version below</p>
            <p>To-do list for this version:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>To-don't list for this version:</p>
            <ul>

            <summary>More Details</summary>
            <p>This version may use objects selectively and aims for readability for newcomers. It will likely support
                more than two players and include a simplified practice mode.</p>
