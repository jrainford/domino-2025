    </p>
    <p>This is the classic version of the game from 1983.</p>
    <p>The game is for 2 players.  The object of the game is to keep going longer than your
        opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
        The board starts out yellow with a black border.  Each player must steer themselves
        into blank, ie yellow space.  They must not hit the border, the other player or themselves.

   <strong>Player controls:</strong>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <th>Player</th>
        <th>Turn Left</th>
        <th>Turn Right</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Player 1</td>
        <td>Q</td>

            This is the classic, but outdated, DOM-based version built years ago. It uses
            standard HTML elements (TABLE, TR, TD) rather than canvas. It also relies on
            <code>document.write</code>, which is long deprecated. It was written in JavaScript
            around 1998. Going back even further, I created the very first version of "domino" in
            1983 on a PDP-11 in Coral-66 running on a VT100 terminal using ANSI escape sequences.
            This 1998 Javascript version plays the same as on the 1983 VT100 version.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name "Domino" came to me back in 1998 as the character-based nature of the terminal
            screen made it look like domino tiles being laid.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am keeping the original as it's uncomplicated by objects, jquery, events etc, so easy to explain to
            someone who's never seen programming of any kind.
            I plan to use the original as a base to include perhaps simple player objects in an array to allow
            multi-player (rather than just 2) and to use the HTML Canvas. I plan to ditch use
            of <code>document.write</code>

        <p>
            This version will use the HTML Canvas rather than an HTML table.
            It may use some objects, but will weigh this up against the benefits of code readibility
            for someone new to programming. The new version will likely allow more than 2 players and
            a "practice" mode to get used to just having 2 keys rather than 4 for each player
